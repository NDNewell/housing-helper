# Affordable Housing Listings

Welcome to the Affordable Housing Listings application! This application was developed to help people find affordable housing options in their area.

## How the application works

The application allows users to search for properties based on their preferences, including occupancy preferences and amenities. Users can also filter their search results by selecting specific amenities, such as wheelchair access or a garage. The search results can be sorted alphabetically or by the number of items per page, and users can navigate between pages to view more results.

## Technologies used

This application was built using React.js and TypeScript for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. The application also uses a JSON file to store the housing listings data.

## Setting up the application

To set up the application, first clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/nicholasnewell/affordable-housing-listings.git

`cd affordable-housing-listings`  
`npm install`

Next, start the development server by running the following command:

The application will now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
